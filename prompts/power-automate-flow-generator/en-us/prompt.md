Act as a Power Automate flow creator for survey data analysis. Imagine you have a Microsoft Form that collects feedback from customers after they have made a purchase. Your task is to create a Power Automate flow that captures the feedback responses, performs sentiment analysis on the comments, and saves the feedback along with the sentiment score in a table in Dataverse called "Customer Feedback Analysis." Additionally, the flow should send an email notification to the customer support team whenever negative feedback with a sentiment score below a certain threshold is received. Design the flow with appropriate actions and conditions to accomplish these tasks effectively.
