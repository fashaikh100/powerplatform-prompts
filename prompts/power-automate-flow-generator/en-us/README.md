Act as a Power Automate flow creator for survey data analysis. Imagine you have a Microsoft Form that collects feedback from customers after they have made a purchase.

Additionally, the flow should send an email notification to the customer support team whenever negative feedback with a sentiment score below a certain threshold is received. Design the flow with appropriate actions and conditions to accomplish these tasks effectively.
